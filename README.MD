This set of exercises focuses on working with pure functions and array methods such as map(), filter(), and splice() to manipulate arrays in JavaScript while ensuring immutability and predictable behavior.

Key Exercises:
Array Multiplication (Exercise 1): Use map() to create a new array where each element of nums is multiplied by 3.

Filter Members (Exercise 2): Utilize filter() and map() to create an array of names from the personnes array where estMember is true.

Pure Function for Adding Inscriptions (Exercise 3): Create a pure function pureAppendInscription that adds a new inscription to the inscriptions array and returns a new array without modifying the original.

Array Modifications (Exercise 4): Use the splice() method to build pure functions for inserting, deleting, and updating inscriptions in the inscriptions array by position or id.

These exercises reinforce the use of pure functions and demonstrate how to manipulate arrays efficiently while maintaining immutability.
